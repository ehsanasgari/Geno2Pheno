# Antibiotic resistance phenotype and analysis for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa

## Antibiotic Resistance Prediction
<ul>
<li>Prediction on individual drugs using SNPs, Gene Exp, Gene Presence/Absence features
<li>Prediction on individual drugs using sequence k-mers
<li>Prediction on multiple drugs jointly: single-label multi-class resistance profile prediction
<li>Prediction on multiple drugs jointly: multi-label multi-class resistance profile


## Antibiotic Resistance Feature Extraction 
<ul>
<li>Finding relevant features to the resistance
<li>X<sup>2<\sup> statistics to find relevant features to the resistance profile
<li>Single drugs
<li>Multiple drugs
<li>Hierarchical clustering of univariate important features
<li>Random Forest important feature extraction
