# GENO2PHENO PIPELINE

## Summary
Geno2Pheno is the second part of Seq2Geno2Pheno bioinformatics software, which is developped for phenotype prediction and characterization using the genotype information. When the Genotype tables already exist it Geno2Pheno can be used as a stand-alone package.
Geno2Pheno has two main functionalities (i) predictive models of the phenotype (ii) marker detection based on the learned predictive models.
The features and functionalities of Geno2Pheno 1.0.0 are detailed as follows:


### Classification of Phenotype


### Marker detection

Geno2Pheno select top Genotypes based on the overall rankings of selected features in the predictive models and output
a list of important features for further investigations. These markers can be basis for further clinical assays.
